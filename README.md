README w/troubleshooting tips and tricks in progress!!!

HTML EMAIL BOILERPLATE

Purpose:
  I started this repo after changing jobs and being assigned emails. I quickly found that while coding them is circa 1998, email clients treat them differently. There are tons of email coding specific websites, forums, and Stack Overflow questions with great answers out there. I'm compiling this repo with the most useful fixes I've found. This also helps me keep track of them.

Email client specific issues I've encountered and fixes I like:

  Android/Email:
  >>Hairlines
  **FYI - Android/Gmail rounds up pixels when resizing table and rounds down pixels when resizing images.**
    1. Try shrinking images by a pixel or two.

  Outlook:
    >>Gap between images
     1. Add a line height to the cell that contains the image. Make it set to the same height as the image.

RESOURCES:
Here are some of my favorite resources.
  1. Litmus: https://litmus.com/resources
  2. Campaign Monitor: https://www.campaignmonitor.com/
    - CSS Reference Guide! Know what css identifiers work in which email client! https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/
  3. Email on Acid - Their forum has a lot of questions/answers: https://www.emailonacid.com/forum
  4. Stack Overflow - search this for previously answered questions :) or post a new one.
